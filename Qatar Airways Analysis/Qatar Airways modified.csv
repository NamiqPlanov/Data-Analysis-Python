1935,6/6/2015,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Graham Williams,United Kingdom,6/6/2015,I flew to Thailand for my honeymoon with Qatar from Manchester to Doha and then on to Bangkok with the same transfer coming home. I have always dreaded long haul flights and never expected what I got with Qatar. It was excellent. Staff were lovely the plane was stunning and the flight was an enjoyable part of our holiday. I can't thank them enough. Due to the previous days wedding and traffic we were 15 minutes late for check in but they took care of us and rushed us on to the plane. I can't thank the staff enough but I will endeavour to make sure our next holiday destination is on a Qatar Plane.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Khanoy-Warshava,3/23/2024,Boeing-442,0,June,2015,Saturday,Positive,June,2015,Saturday,March,2024,,FALSE
1936,6/6/2015,10,10,Qatar Airways customer review,James Vickers,United Kingdom,6/6/2015,24 May LHR-DOH (010) DOH-DXB (1014). 29 May DXB-DOH (1023) DOH-LHR(005). Will keep this simple and say the 4 flights we had with Qatar Airways last week were the best 4 I've had or at least right near the very top (the first one LHR-DOH was unquestionably our best). All 4 flights left on time on the 2 long ones we got constant service on drinks and as well as the meal got 3 other food portions all of which were very nice. On the short 45 mins flight from Doha to Dubai we got a nice sandwich and cake with drinks was very satisfactory and wouldn't have wanted more. The service from the staff was excellent not just on the plane but at the airport all of them were very polite. The inflight entertainment was brilliant with a huge choice of recent releases TV shows etc. The toilets were clean and well kept. The only bug bear would probably be the box below the window seat which limits legroom I had no problem with it but I would imagine that some people might. Overall I enjoyed all the flights and would opt to choose them again next time.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baku-London,3/23/2024,Airbus-310,1,June,2015,Saturday,Positive,June,2015,Saturday,March,2024,,TRUE

My first time on Qatar however I've flown on average once a month over the previous 15 years mainly on the same 5 or 6 airlines premium or business with a few economy and first flights in between. I no longer travel for work longer interested in frequent flier miles or status either so looking forward to trying different airlines on my 3 or 4 holiday trips each year. Check in at T4 quick with seats honoured was able to use the sky team lounge through my FFP status - nice lounge. Boarding the new A380 was quick and organised seated upper deck I was impressed by the space seat and general ambience the best economy I've travelled in. Take off on time a very nice crew kept busy! Drinks and dinner offered. Dinner just ok connection in Doha went fine. Flights between DOH - CPT and return on new 787's I found the 787 noisy and not as comfortable as the A380 both flights on time again pretty good service from nice crews although food not that good. Had a longer connection in Doha on the return trip so gave me a chance to experience the new airport and business lounge which were very nice. Doha back to LHR on an ageing A340-600 which I found comfortable for the 6hr 20min flight!! crew fine food not that good however for the price paid I really cant complain some of the best economy flights I've had I'm looking forward to using Qatar business in around 2 months.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Khanoy-Warshava,3/23/2024,Boeing-442,0,January,2015,Saturday,Positive,June,2015,Monday,March,2024,,FALSE

It's been a few years since I last flew QR so I was interested in seeing whether they'd kept their standards as high as I remembered. Largely I wasn't disappointed and having flown on 777/A330/A340/A380 I got to try out most of their LH types. Cabin crew are still as good aircraft interiors are still pristine (especially on the A380 although understandable as only 6 months old). Hamad International is a great improvement on the old Doha airport for transit. If I were to criticise anything it would be the food. This definitely seems to have deteriorated a bit. Two meals were absolutely inedible which was really surprising.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baku-London,3/23/2024,Airbus-310,1,December,2015,Friday,Positive,May,2015,,March,2024,,TRUE

According to Wikipedia the 19th longest scheduled flight in the world (16h5m). Had seat 1A with no one beside me. Usual obliging service on board from a very courteous and professional crew. Have just got onto an American Airlines flight in first where I basically had my dinner tossed at me - what a difference from QR! Flight left DOH about an hour late due to an equipment change. Nice seat good food. I have no complaints about QR. For this trip I joined their mileage program. Before I was collecting miles on QR flights using my BA account but not getting much in terms of bonus miles or progress toward higher tier status. Decided to switch over to QR's program as I have a lot of travel with QR coming up.,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Khanoy-Warshava,3/23/2024,Boeing-442,0,November,2015,Friday,Positive,May,2015,,March,2024,,FALSE
1954,5/11/2015,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Harold Bush,United Kingdom,11/5/2015,A day before my return to LHR from BKK I received an email from Qatar offering me a good deal for an upgrade to Business Class which I took up. They were meant to start check-in process at BKK airport at 5 pm but did not do so till 5.20. Check in staff was excellent and efficient. I was offered a drink after boarding but not a hot or cold towel. The person next to me was offered both. I opted for a middle seat in order to have aisle access; configuration of 777 is 2-2-2. The seats are indeed very comfortable but there is not much privacy. I was rather disappointed again with the food. I was expecting a lot more. It was all nicely presented and the FAs do go out of their way to make one's journey enjoyable but I do not think the food was as good as people claim and I have had much better food on Cathay and BA in Business. The food from Doha to LHR was even less interesting. And on this leg on an A340-600 the seat was much smaller and with even less privacy. The person next to me almost damaged my glasses which I had put on the little shared area between the seats. The business lounge at Doha is superb but again the food was a let down. My option salmon was not available from the a la carte menu. I had a lamb which was hard and very salty. The buffet stuff looked like something from my local Waitrose and was simple. The snack area was far more interesting. They prepare whatever you want. Lovely. There are many areas in the lounge including a large business room next to which there is an area hardly anyone uses. The so-called 'quiet area' was anything but quiet: people snoring breaking winds pulling trolleys talking etc. The seats are extremely uncomfortable and in no way one can have a good nap there. I do not understand why they cannot put stuff like in the BA's cabanas at T5 with blankets. My verdict is that Qatar Business is good but definitely not well above that of Cathay or BA as people claim.,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Baku-London,3/23/2024,Airbus-310,1,November,2015,Friday,Positive,May,2015,,March,2024,,TRUE

It wasn't my first time that I used QA but I sincerely hoped that their service will improve. I was wrong! Ground staff during the check-in at LHR was not nice. People you need to start smiling! Airbus A340 was spacious so there were no problems with a legroom. Inflight entertainment was ok. Cabin crew was inattentive sometimes not polite. I have asked for a glass of water before they started serving the meal but didn't get any Crew member looked unsatisfied when I interrupted her with a glass of water request. I also had to remind them about the bland meal that I've pre-ordered. Return flight from Abu Dhabi to Doha had 1 hour delay. It was a miracle that I've managed to catch a LHR flight which also arrived in London with a 20-minute delay. Despite their cheap fares I'm not going to fly with Qatar Airways anymore. I'll better pay more for a flight with a competitor airline.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Khanoy-Warshava,3/23/2024,Boeing-442,0,November,2015,Friday,Positive,May,2015,,March,2024,,FALSE

1968,4/10/2015,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M Azam,United Kingdom,10/4/2015,LHR-DOH-HKT 19/3/2015. First leg was the ageing A340 which I must add was a superb aircraft very comfortable. Second leg was a A330-300 not so great seats felt worn out. Service wise I have found having travelled with Qatar that it would appear they put their 'best' staff on the Heathrow route and other routes such as Phuket tend to get staff with lower ability. Overall having been a loyal customer of Qatar over the years I am not sure I will be in the future. I agree with other comments that Qatar are riding on past reputations. Food is average at best. Inflight service is now lip service and crew tend to walk past whilst offering teas and coffees without actually making eye contact. And entering and leaving the aircraft they might as well have no one on the doors. They did however provide bassinets for my kids (although on the Phuket flight crew never assembled it correctly).

Certainly spacious but does not feel as opulent as Emirates A380. Second leg was an A340 which was fine. Service really wasn't great.

Whilst not directly related to Qatar - The New Hamad Airport has a lack of signage and direction and the lack of air bridges and speed of connections is appalling for what is supposed to be a new state of the art airport.

Outbound flight good friendly check in assistant who allocated me an emergency exit seat with extra leg room because of my disability. Worst problem was the 7 hour wait in Doha which we were aware of. However on the return flight unfriendly and unwilling to assist at check in even though I am registered on their site as disabled and therefore not able to check in online no assistance given. We were given our tickets and thankfully I checked our connection from Doha to Manchester and it had been changed and we were not informed. This resulted in a six hour wait in Doha instead of an hour and half. No assistance given on either leg of journey to allocate me extra legroom and only when we were about to board the flight from Doha to Manchester we then discovered we were in separate rows but I had been allocated a middle seat which with my disability makes it worse. We managed to change seats on the airplane thanks to a helpful fellow traveler but with no assistance from the airline crew.

These seats are a total disaster with a major design flaw. For sitting and lounging they are OK. When going flat however the footrest goes DOWN despite plenty of space and the midsection goes up.

On London to Doha QF seems to use a mix of aircraft for their many daily flights I experienced the A340-300 both there and back. The aircraft is starting to show its age the seats are uncomfortable and the picture / sound quality on the video on demand sets poor compared to what you get on more modern aircraft these days. However the legroom seemed generous compared to BA Virgin et al. Service was good though on the way back they switched on the lights on a night flight while still over Romania so a good two and a half hours from Heathrow to serve breakfast. Doha's new Hamed International Airport is brand new and a pleasant place to transit through and from Doha to Dubai Qatar used a Dreamliner for what's only a 45 min flight. Despite small issues here and there I'd definitely take them again. They were the cheapest on the route and the experience is still better than what you get on most European (let alone N American) carriers long haul. QF and the other Middle Eastern airlines also haven't introduced the practice of making you pay to choose your seat and if you use the app you can change it as many times as you want (in my case I managed to get a free seat next to me on each stretch) pre check in.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Khanoy-Warshava,3/23/2024,Boeing-442,0,September,2015,Wednesday,Positive,March,2015,,March,2024,,FALSE

The flight was virtually empty so I just got up and opened up all the blinds that the cabin crew had shut so that I could see out and enjoy the spectacular views of Mt Ararat amongst other things.

After an on-time departure from JNB the bell went off to signal to the cabin crew that they could leave their jump seats to start their work in the cabin. Several passengers in the business class cabin took this as an indication that they could leave their seats even though the seat belt sign was still illuminated. A woman in the row ahead of me got up to use the lavatory. I told her that the seat belt sign was still on so she returned to her seat. Another passenger from row 1 started making his way down the aisle to the lavatory so the woman in front of me said “why don't you tell him”. So I also told him that the seat belt sign was still on and he returned to his seat. When the sign was eventually turned off about ten minutes later the woman in front of me while going to the lavatory stopped at my seat and said “do I have your permission to go to the washroom?” Honestly the crew should be paying more attention not leaving it to passengers to tell other passengers when it is safe to move around the cabin.

Despite dashing through security and arriving at the gate I was refused boarding and told that the plane had left.

Food reasonable service seemed a little slow but overall a good first leg of the trip. There's only a 45 minute layover in Doha but they are well geared up for this and no trouble with missing luggage despite the gates being at opposite ends of the airport. Second leg to Melbourne on a 777-300ER almost full seats nowhere near as comfortable far less leg room. Better entertainment system than the Airbus matt screen so no reflection problems.

2016,2/12/2015,6,10,Qatar Airways customer review,B Ghannadian,United States,12/2/2015,I flew Qatar last month multiple times DFW-DOH-IKA-DOH-MED JED-DOH-IKA-DOH-DFW. Have to say I agree with one of the previous reviews regarding staff behavior change as soon as they see a business or first class ticket. Had to change my boarding pass in Dallas while staying in the line the staff were really inattentive and not caring. As soon as I handed over my boarding pass all of the sudden the attitude changed and maybe apologized 4-5 times for making me wait in the line! Flight attendants are nice. Very polite some happier than others but overall very attentive. The food selection was not appealing to my taste but good specially if you are a fan of middle eastern and Indian types of food. Drink selections were really good. The meals are served a la cart. Has its own cons and pros. It is good to have the option of having what you want when you want. However can be bothersome in a sense specially when the cabin lights are turned off and are trying to get some sleep and the passenger next to you is trying to eat. Overall more satisfied with the short haul business class flights compare to long haul. Seats are very comfortable and wide. Plenty of legroom. I would be happy if the seat had a little separator/divider to give a little more privacy while sleeping specially if the passenger next to you chooses to read watch TV or eat. Doha airport is huge. Not the best airport for short layovers. Make sure you have at lease 90 minutes between two flight. I had 50 minutes and missed my flight. If everything goes well and right on schedule 50 minutes would have been enough but can be too short if your flight is delayed even 5 minutes and plane is not parked at a jetway and passengers are taken to the airport by the bus and so on. Airport staff are nice. Some are really helpful some not much I guess like anywhere else. The lounge is huge. Very contemporary decor. Not many food or drink options in the main sitting area. Two restaurants which can be very over crowded. Restrooms are very insufficient.,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Baku-London,3/23/2024,Airbus-310,1,December,2015,Tuesday,Positive,February,2015,,March,2024,,TRUE

On boarding went to lavatory to put on sweat pants and a tee-shirt and was offered on the way in a clothes hanger by the purser for the clothes I was changing out of. Nice touch. He came around and introduced himself to each biz passenger. One arm rest wouldn't move with the electronic function. Next thing I knew there was an engineer member of the ground staff lying in the aisle looking under my seat with a flashlight. Couldn't fix the problem but he sure tried. Food and service during the flight were excellent. Just before arrival in DOH the purser informed me that I would miss my connection to KWI and had been rebooked on a later flight. A member of the ground staff met me on disembarkment in DOH and took me immediately to the gate for my KWI flight which was delayed anyway due to fog in KWI. Lots of good attention from QR on these flights.

We had checked in online the night before so no long queues for us! Boarding was fast and efficient at ARN as usual. Was quite excited to fly on the 787 for the first time and I was fairly impressed by the mood lighting in the cabin. However the cabin felt quite cramped in this 9-abreast configuration.

Overall a great experience on this 6 hour flight. Transfer was smooth in the new Hamad airport. Next flight DOH- DAC on an A333. They changed the operating aircraft to a three class A333. The staff at DOH handled the situation well and new seats were given. My father got seated in business and the rest of us in Y. Flight was 95-100% full in Y. Overall a nice flight with friendly crew decent IFE and decent seats. The only letdown was the food. DAC- DOH operated by an A333 once again the flight was completely packed in business and economy. Boarding was smooth and we were off to DAC. Flight was great as usual with QR nice crew decent IFE and decent seats. The food was quite tasteless and once again the only letdown with this flight. Transfer in Doha was smooth as usual. DOH-ARN operated by A7-BCB I had bought the same plane in 1:200 from DOH. Load factor in Y was about 80-85%. The flight was great as usual except the food arrival at ARN was smooth. I was quite satisfied with QR except on the catering department.

The A330-200 on SGN-DOH business class seats are flat but not fully horizontal (only decline to 165 degrees) making sleeping horrible. Night-kit and nice cotton pyjamas provided. Service top notch and wines in ultra-top class! Food served on demand and excellent but portions have become very small recently and 2-3 dishes are needed to make up a full meal. FA's the most professional alert and caring I have experienced for long time. Now 4 beers to choose among and the 2 champagne offered are exclusive though still beaten by some of the wines served.

Flew the A300-200 from Doha to Manchester (UK) business class and this plane is really showing its age now. Seats are not that comfortable for a 7 hr flight and again the food was only just adequate.

All food on all flights was excellent. Again the food on the Perth - Doha flight was particularly good. Found the 787 seats from Joburg to Doha more comfortable than the 777. You did not need a mattress on this flight as the seat in the lie flat position is so well padded. I love the pod with the extra table room and the shoe storage area. Even with the mattress double thick on the 777 you can still not sleep comfortably on your side. Did not have this problem on the 787. All flights were on time or early. Not a huge fan of the new business class lounge at Hamad Int'l. Not as well designed or sign posted inside as it should be. The seating is great but the design does not flow for me.

Outbound flight in a modernised A330 with a much smaller IFE box under the seat (makes a big difference to leg room) return flight in an older A330 with the much-larger IFE box and the older-style IFE interface. Leg room not an issue as both flights were half-empty so I had the whole row to myself. Seats on both sectors were very uncomfortable: I always found them comfortable before and the seats look quite new so I suspect that cheaper/uncomfortable seats are now being installed. Cost-cutting and deteriorating standards are now evident elsewhere: tray tables not properly cleaned less food than on previous flights (and worse quality) poorly maintained toilet facilities and very unhappy-looking FAs on both flights. Online booking page kept returning server errors - I tried to make changes to my schedule on several occasions back home as well as in Hong Kong with similar errors noted in both countries. I'm hoping that all this was just a one-off or perhaps QR's previously flawless service has led me to expect too much. But for the first time I didn't enjoy the flights that much at all. It won't stop me from booking with them again but if this situation continues I will definitely consider switching to another carrier for my flights to east Asia.

The seat layout is 2x4x2 why cant they just put us as a couple in the window/aisle seat?

Service onboard the Doha to Paris flight in first class was excellent. The stewardess was attentive and efficient. There were no other passengers in the first class cabin so I felt really pampered. Unfortunately the food was only average and the entertainment channels were not that great. Pity as the service onboard was top class. I also noticed that the advertised chauffeur drive from the terminal to the plane for first class was not made available to me. Overall I find Qatar Airways provide great service onboard but I would have some hesitation flying with them in the future for a few reasons. Firstly I prefer airlines that offer Business Class seats with direct access to the aisle. Secondly the lounge while impressive should have more shower rooms to cope with the volume of passengers. Thirdly Qatar does not provide a limousine service to and from the airport. Finally the food and entertainment onboard should be better. For flights to and from Kuala Lumpur the option of Malaysian dishes should be provided. The choice of music needs to be revamped. I will be comparing prices with other airlines closely before deciding if I would fly Qatar Airways again. I would recommend it for their excellent staff onboard but the service on the ground can be improved.,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Khanoy-Warshava,4/12/2023,Boeing-442,0,December,2014,,Positive,November,2014,,April,2023,,FALSE

As you board the plane you notice your first difference. The entrance of the 787 is very open and grand. You nearly feel like you're walking into a lobby area. Then you notice the windows which are truly big. Love the expansive feeling you get by being so connected to the outside. When you finally get to the new business class seat which has a very spacious 1-2-1 configuration you realize why Qatar is one of the few 5-star airlines. The reverse herring bone layout has you facing into the large windows and has by far the best design I've ever seen given this configuration even in sleep mode. An excellent dining experience. If there is one slight doubt it's with the new IFE system which takes some time getting used to. It's a complete redesign and not always logical. At least to me. Did I mention the spacious lavatories?

Great cabin crew very friendly and polite. The food onboard seems less then last time in 2013 and that was a bit disappointment. Transfer at DOH beautiful new airport great design. Flight from Doha to Ho Chi Minh with the A330. The IFE onboard seems pretty old old seats and no touch screen. Many movies but not so many movies in the action category. SGN-DOH - Pleasant and an enjoyable flight. Landed on time. The problem was that my next flight to Doha- Oslo was leaving 9 hours later so pretty boring to wait so long. Great restaurant and food in the airport. B787 for the next flight. Good flight but I found out that the music didn't work and played different songs to those selected. Food was ok but I wish it was more. I sat on the back and didn't get my choice of food but that was ok. Landed on time at Oslo.

It felt like a sauna and even the crew agreed but couldn't do anything about it. The vegetarian meals I ordered were not inspiring. The light snacks are a piece of sweet and a piece of savoury. The savoury was just OK the sweet was dry and burned i.e: inedible. On board Staff were miss and go. Most of the crew (Asians and Arabs) were friendly and genuinely eager to please but some of the Eastern European ladies were cold and not very approachable. Doha Airport is new and impressive. My connection was 5 hours long and so I went to the Ortyx Lounge that charges around $40 (140QR). The Lounge was very busy (500+ people) and there is only one shower facility. Luckily I found a slot to shower else the onward flight would have been even more awful than the first. I was happy to got an emergency exit seat (10D) on the DOH - MXP flight to discover this was the worst possible choice of seat. It is on an 'angle' and so it provides even less legroom than the regular seats with people going in and out of toilet and the crew bumping into me non stop.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Khanoy-Warshava,4/12/2023,Boeing-442,0,March,2014,,Positive,November,2014,Wednesday,April,2023,,FALSE

New wines in economy and for the first time after 50 flights with QR they changed the beer to Foster from the usual Heineken. So a boring brand replaced by an even more boring brand. However hot snacks were tasty service on board excellent and caring. From BKK till Hanoi 3 days later I was upgraded to business class by 8 only Q-credits (from Privilege FF-Program). What a pleasure in the Airport as fast track gives you better service. The Lounge (they use Thai Airways lounges) was very spacious and quiet but no wines nor champagnes were offered. Food displayed nicely but hardly acceptable except for loads of Chinese dishes (all Chinese tend to go to Thailand these days as they are not welcomed in Vietnam). The QR flight (got seat 1K in a 2x2x2 configuration) and service onboard was very very good and matches that of a 5-stars airline as Qatar retains.,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Khanoy-Warshava,4/12/2023,Boeing-442,0,August,2014,,Positive,October,2014,,April,2023,,FALSE

The privilege club silver lounge was hard to find – I was sent from one lounge to the next [visiting 4 in all] before I found the right one - the staff seemed confused about who could use which lounge.

Very comfortable to sleep on but the overall lack of space (as this is a narrow-bodied plane) makes you feel very close to your neighbours on either side. Service was rather disorganised with crew going back and forth constantly. Flight attendants were not rude but tended to be mechanical - this was a general impression I had on my other flights with Qatar. DOH- SIN-DOH (787 business): Amazing plane. Occupancy was low for this sector making an already spacious cabin seem more spacious with the seats very private. Lots of space for storage and seat was great for sleeping. Crew this time was better professional but not friendly apart from the cabin director who seemed genuine in welcoming people aboard. This is probably my favourite plane so far (better than the A380). DOH-MXP (A330): old plane with average seats (inclined flat seats not very comfortable for sleeping) washrooms were not very clean - the worst leg of the entire journey. The 'highlight' of this flight was excellent service from one Thai flight attendant: helpful and friendly. Overall: I found Qatar to be a well-priced airline offering good competent service. Food was above average (better than BA worse than SQ/Emirates) but portions were small (and I'm not a big eater). In- flight entertainment was a bit limited and the touch-screen controls were not the most intuitive and responsive. Plus with Qatar part of the Oneworld alliance - there are more opportunities to accrue points. Downsides: the shared Sala Montale lounge at Malpensa is depressing.

The DOH-RGN flight was good on the small A319 which only had 60 Passengers on board this helped as it meant the crew were more attentive. For the return we tried to upgrade at the Tokyo office offering to pay however we were told that because the DOH-LHR leg was full we could not even pay for the HND-DOH leg meaning the flight would have empty business class seats. The flight however from HND-DOH was very nice as the Tokyo office sent a message to check in stating that we would like extra legroom seats which was a nice touch. The DOH-LHR flight on the other hand was terrible a downgrade from the A380 to the A340 meant that the flight was totally full and the plane was showing its age with broken seats and dirty toilets.

The way the layout is you always get distracted by the TV screens of other passengers you cannot concentrate on your reading nor can you watch something peacefully.

2150,7/6/2014,5,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Charles Kennedy,United Kingdom,6/7/2014,LHR-DOH-NBO. First leg was in business disappointed to find Qatar are still using angled lie-flat seats in business class a curse I thought has lifted from all decent airlines. It is probably easier for a customer to learn to fly than it is to find a comfortable sleeping position in these things. Another gripe the entertainment system wasn't working at all. I was happy to read but another very basic omission from an airline that promises so much. Finally despite the potential of an a la carte menu which most airlines only offer in F class (if ever) the food was completely without any flavour at all. On the other hand the fish may have been bland but the cabin crew were the catch of the day not only kind and helpful but also intelligent and articulate. Transit at the new Doha airport was easy and the building itself is stylish and functional - can't wait to come back. Finally the flight to Nairobi in economy on an A320 was great three choices of food (my vegetarian curry was very tasty) and working IFE meant I could finally catch up on two movies I hadn't been able to enjoy on the first leg.

For outgoing trip it was a red- eye flight at 3.30 am QR 851 (KUL-DOH) Airbus 330-200 with USB port near the arm rest. The journey was smooth without any turbulence. Two nice meals were served - snack was served once onboard and breakfast was served before landing. A small pouch was given to all passengers which include eye mask etc. IFE was nice with touchscreen features and plenty of movies and songs. The transfer at Doha New Airport was a breeze although I needed to walk quite a long way from the landing gate to the transfer screening. Next flight would be QR 23 (DOH- MAN) Airbus 330-300 without USB port. This aircraft looked a bit old but the seat pitch was much better than the previous one. IFE was nice without touchscreen features. Two meals were served - breakfast was served once onboard and snack was served before landing. For incoming trip QR 004 (LHR- DOH) at 1505 Boeing 777-300ER with USB port. Two nice meals were served - lunch was served once onboard and snack was served before landing. IFE was nice with touchscreen features and plenty of movies and songs. The seat pitch is good. Next flight would be QR 848 (DOH - KUL) at 115 Airbus 330-200 with USB port. IFE was nice with touchscreen features. Two meals were served - snack was served once onboard and lunch was served before landing. For all flights beverages were offered a few times along the journey. The cabin crews were very attentive whenever there was a request from the passengers.

The movie choices were also disappointed being very old and not updated to the current months entertainment suite. Food was very good cabin crew were sweet but seemed extremely flustered. Second flight (DOH-LCA) on an old A320. First thing I noticed was there was no inflight entertainment which was very sad however it was a shortish flight so not a big issue. For the most part cabin crew were very nice except one lady who was rather obnoxious and put a sour taste in my mouth for the rest of the journey.

Under the old regime Business Class passengers regardless of their loyalty status benefited from a separate terminal that provided a very good seating area separate check in and boarding facilities. At the new airport this is currently not available and no lounge access to all Business Class passengers. Lounge is only accessible if you are a gold or silver card holder even if you paid a full price business class ticket. They indicated however that you would be able to access the lounge by the way of paying an extra fee! Flight experience on the other hand was fine. Crew is very good.

The Hollywood selection was good but the world cinema choices were poor. The food was exactly the same as I had 2 years before on the very same flight. It was tasteless. The crew were good just did what they had to. The flight from Doha to Amritsar was much better on a new Airbus A321. IFE was faster and easier to use but same movies. Arrived on time in India.

Night flight out of SIN so slept most of the way. Morning flight to Athens. Not a fan of the old A330 seat but overall no major issues. Return journey was evening departure from Athens on the 320. More like a regional biz seat and feels a little cramped. Seems to be too smaller plane for a 5 hour sector IMO. This was followed by the 787 which is fantastic in every sense. Again a night flight - Slept very well and look forward to being on this plane again in the summer. New airport both ways - Will be a big improvement when ready but why it has opened with 1 pathetic lounge I really don't understand.

2176,6/2/2014,9,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Thomas Reeh,Australia,2/6/2014,On 4th May I flew from Melbourne to Manchester via Doha with Qatar Airways. Qatar Airways is affiliated with One World so lounge access is provided at Melbourne Airport by Qantas always a good way to start a long journey. The plane for the first sector was a brand new Boeing 777 and on a full flight I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of room in economy. I am 6ft 3in (189cms) and I could stretch out quite comfortably without touching the seat in front. I was sat in 23K. In flight entertainment was excellent with Premiere release movies and a host of documentaries to help while the hours away (all 14 hrs and 15 minutes for the first sector). Service and inflight catering was excellent with a good choice of food and regular water runs by the cabin crew. Landing in Doha was probably the only negative as the airport was packed and hectic. With a tight transit time of just 60 minutes I was fearing the worst but somehow it all seemed to happen and I made the connection. The second sector of 7hrs and 30 minutes was completed in an Airbus A330 which was notably smaller and older than the Boeing 777. However the service was on par and food and entertainment options again superior. All in all a pleasant experience for what is a gruelling distance to fly.

2177,6/2/2014,2,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Derek Gilboe,Saudi Arabia,2/6/2014,Qatar Airways provides commendable in-flight services particularly in their business/first cabins. The flight crews are always focused on service doing their utmost to ensure passenger comfort. Highlights of the airline are the newer aircraft and a strong focus on the aircraft interiors that maximize passenger comfort particularly the large overhead bins on their Boeing aircraft and newer Airbus fleet additions. Food on the flights in business is excellent with choices for breakfast indulgence (snack) and main meals with a broad selection of wines. Equally nice are the sleepwear provided on longer flights with the extra padding in the sleep covers for the business/first seats. While the in-flight experience is excellent the airline is facing challenges with the terminal and transit experience. Outside of Doha lounges were very limited although joining OneWorld has opened up many new lounges suitable for premium customers; unfortunately they face ground staff issues at several airports that frustrate during the boarding and deplaning process. The new airport in Doha their primary hub is open but facing considerable growing pains and still relies on buses for many airport transits. Coupled with insufficient lounge space particularly for their premium customers significantly compromises the overall trip experience and turns their new flagship airport in Doha to a frustrating experience that undermines the excellent in-flight service and value for the money in the competitive market of air travel.,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Khanoy-Warshava,4/12/2019,Boeing-442,0,February,2014,Saturday,Positive,June,2014,Tuesday,April,2019,,FALSE

On the first flight there was a family consisting of husband wife and children all in business but with a number of maids and a baby in economy. During the flight the maids were constantly coming into the business section and squeezing between the seats and using the toilets. When I asked the cabin manager whether it was Qatar Airways’ policy to allow economy passengers to walk around the business cabin he said it was not but this particular passenger was listed on the manifest as a ‘VVIP’ which meant they could do nothing about it. At one level it was an excellent experience – the quality of the food in both the lounges (LHR and DOH) and on the aircraft was remarkable and the cabin crew were consistently friendly responsive and effective. The Boeing 777 seats were comfortable and the IFE varied and stimulating. All of the aircraft were clean and although one of them was getting old there were no signs of wear. Qatar Airways wants to sell itself as the ‘World’s 5-star airline’ but it must ensure that it behaves like one and not allow its VIPs to let their staff enjoy the business cabin without actually paying for it.,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Khanoy-Warshava,4/12/2019,Boeing-442,0,November,2014,Friday,Positive,May,2014,,April,2019,,FALSE

The check-in at Changi airport was really smooth and the check in staff were really quick and helpful. The inflight meals and service were exceptional. Qatar Airways proves again and again why its a 5-star airline mostly due to their customer service cabin service and exceptional professionalism. The kids really loved the IFE inflight service and the caring staff. The transit at DOH was pretty quick and the next flight to YUL was a long one again. The cabin staff and the inflight service made our long journey a very relaxing one and enjoyable one. Hats off to Qatar airways staff.

Online check-in was fine and worked well at LHR and the Premium Lounge at Heathrow is good with good service and decent food. LHR-DOH leg was on new Dreamliner and all-in-all pretty good. DOH-JNB leg was on a quite new Boeing 777. Service on both legs was very attentive and the food and drinks not bad if uninspiring and not as good as Emirates or SAA on the same LHR-JNB trip. Wine selection wasn't wide but acceptable. Seats were fine if a little narrower on the B777 and didn't fold into a completely flat bed which is disappointing and again not as good as Emirates but we did manage to sleep reasonably well. IFE was pretty good on all legs. Standards and aircraft on the return trips were the same but both departures from Doha were delayed; by 50 minutes on the return leg and by 55 minutes on the outbound 50 of which were spent sitting the tarmac. Doha airport is a mess with a quite long ""luxury"" bus trip from the Arrivals and the Premium Transfer Terminal. The Qatar lounge in the Premium Terminal at Doha is good if rather large and impersonal and Qatar use the Shongolo Lounge at JNB which is pretty good although a little in need of decoration at the far end near the windows.

Flying through middle east is slightly shorter than the traditional stop in Singapore or another Asian city and Qatar is about as good as economy class gets. The food was excellent and the drinks and snacks service which came several times on the longer Doha-Melb leg the noticeable difference with other full service airlines. That and they still give you the little toothbrush and socks. That longer leg to Melbourne is also overnight in both directions which is handy for sleeping and staying on your body clock.

B777 is superb but older Airbus A330/340 product not as good but believe they are having interior upgrade to newer B787 style - we flew our first B787 on the initial LHR-DOH leg and it was fantastic. Could not pick a single fault and as a plane geek it truly is an amazing aircraft made the B777 feel almost outdated which is crazy as they are still fantastic aircraft and so spacious. Both were less than a month old! Qatar lounge in LHR is a real treat-up there with the BA Concorde Room in my opinion - worth getting there early just to enjoy the food wine and ambience. Looking forward to the new Doha airport as current transit can be a bit of a bore but would still chose to fly Qatar above any other airline despite the connection.

The flight from Doha to KL was excellent also: flight attendants present and anticipating your needs. The food very good indeed. My only problem with the Airbus 330-300 is the angled seats when trying to sleep. I thoroughly dislike them as there is not much space to put things away and one is not lying flat (I need a flat surface for medical reasons).

When breakfast service finally started we were informed that only 2 of the 5 mains that were listed on the menu were available. They were a choose of pancakes or waffles. Basically not much of a choice. When I asked if I could get more fruit or muesli I was told 'No'. The snack that was offered just before landing was also very limited and nothing of interest. Overall the in-flight service was terrible. Their response to my comments about the lack of choice for breakfast was that if I wanted a special meal I should have requested one.

Very friendly and attentive service from dominantly Eastern European and Subcontinental crews. 1-2-1 configuration in 788 business class very nice indeed and A320 business class quite comfortable too (even though not good for sleeping). Some inconsistencies in service on some flights my oneworld Emerald status was acknowledged on some not. A very annoying aspect of Qatar service is that the oneworld Emerald status does not give you access to First class facilities and you don’t get First class labelling to your luggage. This is different from other oneworld carriers with First class (at least British Airways Cathay Pacific and Qantas) and puts Qatar in an inferior position. The IFE was quite impressive (also on A320s) but did not match the latest IFE on Cathay 77Ws. Qatar provides top notch quality but I would say that Cathay is par at food and beverages but still slightly better in service and much better in attention to details. Cathay’s First class lounges are very nice too its difficult to provide a comparison as I was not admitted to the Qatari facility. In summary I probably will consider Qatar to destinations in East and West Africa and the Middle East but necessarily to South East Asia as changing planes in Doha late in the evening is a nuisance when compared to flying the long Europe – Asia leg non-stop after having enjoyed BA/CX First class hospitality while waiting for the flight.,Solo Leisure,Business Class,Baku-London,2/6/2020,Airbus-310,1,March,2014,Tuesday,Positive,February,2014,Wednesday,February,2020,Saturday,TRUE

The inflight system especially on the Dreamliner is worth its name. The seat comfort on the 777 is superior to the 787 but legroom is adequate in both for a person my size (I am 176cm). The flight crew on the flight deck are very well trained. Communication is excellent. But service quality is not being lived up to by the cabin crew. On both flights we had an extremely tired and unamused looking crew. No smiles no communication. Secondly: the food! While the chicken on the way from Zurich to Doha was easily a masterpiece the meal on the leg from Doha was simply inedible. Layover in Doha is something to be avoided.

Flight operations were fine helped by the mostly very friendly and responsive staff and the use of state-of-the-art equipment (777/787). The choice and quality of the food was however nothing to rave about. Whatever its length any layover at Doha is painful to say the least. This is partially due to the poor infrastructure of the airport but also due to the rather chaotic organization of the airline's ground operations. On the way back I had a 8+ hour layover. I did not want to spend this time at the airport and booked a hotel. When enquiring at Zurich airport if I could leave the airport at Doha I was informed that this may be difficult. We still got off at the Arrival Terminal and - while the waiting period (about 1 hour) and the visa-on- arrival charge was a kick in the teeth immigration was smooth but getting away from the airport was again somewhat frustrating. The airline has potential but has to improve its ground services.

2292,1/2/2014,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,T Yang,Singapore,2/1/2014,Flew SIN-DOH-IAD in late October 2013 on J Class. As always excellent Bollinger served. I like the eat on demand service as we can time the meals. Great choice and great amenities. On route back we had a 8.5 hour lay over and had booked a room. But the thought of negotiating immigration was not very appealing and whiled away the time in the Premium lounge. Had sleeper couches and even fresh blankets and a great shower with L'Occitane toiletries.

Overall the plane quality and cleanliness are good or above average but in regards to the facilities the USB port on the seats on all airlines seems not to work properly. It doesn't charge properly. It may seems small matters but arriving in a destination without working phone is troublesome and unable to contact anyone in emergency. Service on the BUC-DOH was rude and ignorant.

We even got a honeymoon cake on the first leg. Not a problem with the airline at all just some rude travellers flying with us. MAN-DOH Airbus A330-200 a bit tired but by no means old DOH-DPS Boeing 777-200ER modern aircraft and comfortable. The return journey however was a shambles (20/11/13). Denpasar to Doha with a stop in Singapore. DOH-MAN was a great flight although slightly rough arrived one hour early and the head Flight Attendant was very very pleasant with me and made me feel comfortable despite my fears.

2307,12/9/2013,8,10,Qatar Airways customer review,Karen Clark,Australia,9/12/2013,DPS-ORD-DPS. Our flight was delayed 4 hours out of Denpasar due to APEC being held in Bali and the airport being closed to the public at certain hours of the day. We knew this in advance and asked to change our flight a day earlier as we only had a 3 hour lay over in Doha before our flight to Chicago. Qatar assured us that the airport closure would not affect them and that changing our flight would incur a fee. We were met at Doha airport by ground staff who gave us the option of staying overnight or flying to Chicago without our luggage. As we had only two nights in Chicago we decided to fly without our luggage. The luggage arrived at our hotel the next day. In the air we always find the product and the service given very good and of a uniform quality. Our return flight left on time from Chicago with a 5 hour wait for our flight to Bali. This turned into a 12 wait as our flight was delayed. The captain made an announcement explaining the delay and apologized for any inconvenience This is the second time I have experienced problems with connections being late and whilst I understand these things happen I hope it does not become the norm. It feels like this airline is growing very fast and needs the new airport and new aircraft to keep up with demand. Their business class product is very good and we were not disappointed once we were in the air.,Couple Leisure,Business Class,Khanoy-Warshava,2/6/2020,Boeing-442,0,September,2013,,Positive,December,2013,,February,2020,Saturday,FALSE

The flight from Goa to Doha was an A321 which did not have fully lie flats seats but recliner type seats which were ok considering the flight was short and lasted only for about 3.5 hours. The service on the flight was excellent and staff addressed you by name. The food was good but it was more in the continental style. The premium lounge in Doha was superb with an excellent spread and nice ambience. The shower areas were great. The flight from Doha to JFK was a Boeing 777-300 ER which had fully lie flat seats and were really comfortable. The AVOD system was good. Service provided by staff was again excellent and they made an extra effort to make you comfortable. Pyjamas sets were provided plus Salvatore Ferragmo pouches. Food was good but again of continental style rather the Middle Eastern style which was my preference. The luggage arrived before economy class and we were out clearing immigration in no time. On the return flight from JFK airport the American Airlines lounge called the Admirals lounge was pathetic you could only get one coke water or beer per person. You could have a few cookies some fruit and some salty titbits as complimentary everything else you had to pay for. The return flight was very similar to outbound flight and same great service was provided with similar amenities.

That said new airport must open ASAP as it will make the experience much more pleasant. Staff attentive and friendly but would have liked to see a few more smiles especially during service time. Food and beverages good well presented. Cabin atmosphere nice and relaxing but the seat comfort on the dreamliner not so good. Pre-departure services efficient but I have seen better and far more impressive. IFE needs to be updated and offer more alternatives. Too much Bollywood and Arabic stuff needs more options. DOH-DXB we were not offered headphones because 'it is a very short flight' as we were advised. Their 4-star competition does offer headsets on this route though.

2332,10/10/2013,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,M Kent,United Kingdom,10/10/2013,Aspires to be a 'five' star airline. We flew UK to Malaysia via Doha two 7hr legs with a 3hr stop over in Doha. Planes were pretty clean seats fairly comfortable but we had a much newer plane on the 2nd outbound leg and this was the best leg of our return trips. Staff were very nice drinks plentiful and varied food pretty good too. Entertainment system worked fine good selection of films/TV to keep you busy. MAS we have flown before are a 5* airline the planes and service just that bit better though you do pay more. Baggage allowance was increased just before we flew to 30kg. They are also fairly relaxed on hand luggage which does mean the overhead storage fills up! The transfer in Doha involved a lengthy bus shuttle to/from the terminal building but perhaps we were unlucky where our planes were parked. I'd use again but would weigh up the saving over a direct flight as there's not much in Doha!,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baku-London,2/6/2020,Airbus-310,1,October,2013,,Positive,October,2013,,February,2020,Saturday,TRUE
2333,10/10/2013,7,10,Qatar Airways customer review,R John,Australia,10/10/2013,MEL-DOH-BCN. I think it is important that if you have connecting flight via DOH you need at least a 2 hour transit time between flights because the bussing between the planes and terminal is painstakingly slow. This will of course improve when the new airport is finished. I've come to the conclusion that a long haul economy flight on any airline can become hell on earth after several hours. Crying babies and a too cold cabin only add to the discomfort. The seat in front of me seemed to recline just a little too far and I felt literally boxed in. Qatar do make an effort to make flights a little more comfortable. Great food and staff as well as comfortable seating certainly helped.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Khanoy-Warshava,2/6/2020,Boeing-442,0,October,2013,,Positive,October,2013,,February,2020,Saturday,FALSE

IAH-DOH - Incoming aircraft had a lightening strike on its way in and needed a complete check by engineers in Houston. This delayed the flight by over 5 hours and everyone missed connections in DOH. Qatar staff in Doha came through for everyone with alternate flights already worked out by the time we reached DOH. Most people were provided transit visas and accommodation with a generous food allowance in DOH. IFE was good food was okay. Cabin staff was polite and helpful. DOH-CCU - Cabin crew excellent. I had a non functional IFE screen and they tried a restart thrice. After that they switched my seat. The food service was thorough service was attentive and I felt comfortable in a flight with service after a long time. CCU-DOH - Good cabin crew good food and attentive service. Ground staff from Air India could not keep up with the Qatar staff and fumbled the service all through. On the flight smooth sailing. DOH-IAH - Attentive cabin crew and good service all round. The only negative was when they ran out of meal options for the lunch service and had to force the same veg option on everyone. IFE malfunctioned during the flight and they reset the whole system that took 30 mins or so. However IFE service was good. Overall satisfied with the service crew and IFE. It would be better for them to rethink their Indian choice for veg as the food tends to get too dry over a long haul flight.,Couple Leisure,Economy Class,Khanoy-Warshava,2/6/2020,Boeing-442,0,February,2013,,Positive,October,2013,Tuesday,February,2020,Saturday,FALSE

Pouches with toothbrush socks ear plugs and eye-mask were given out on the overnight sectors. Only thing that could get better was on the BRU- DOH sector crew ran out of food trays at the back of the plane and had to ask a few times from the crew in the front. I also had to remind the crew that my travelling companion needed a diabetic meal. But these are small issues. In all value for money better than the other airlines who try to pack close to 400 passengers on their 777s for the same price.,Solo Leisure,Economy Class,Baku-London,2/6/2020,Airbus-310,1,January,2013,,Positive,October,2013,Monday,February,2020,Saturday,TRUE

Despite the length of this journey (22 hours) I thoroughly enjoyed it. Perth - Doha leg was onboard a B777-200LR a very comfortable aircraft. The IFE was brilliant and I was well entertained by (literally) 100s of movies games and television shows. The cabin was ambient with a lovely mood-lighting system. The connection at Doha International was smooth and took me just 1hr and 30 minutes to be onboard my London-bound flight coming from the 777. Doha is a very pleasant airport and a much newer one is on the way. The London leg was onboard B787 and had a very comfortable arrangement (as do all Qatar Aircraft) with Thales IFE.

When the meal trolley came we were told instead of the 3 meal options only one was still available. 2) When I asked for a glass of wine I was told it would be brought later. It arrived after my meal was finished. 3) On the return leg my wife who has a bladder problem asked if the trolley could be moved to allow her out. She was told she would have to wait until the attendants had finished and were ready to move on. 4) QR31 25 August was heavily booked. When the lights were brightened after approximately 10 hours there was naturally a rush for the toilets. The number provided on the 777 is in my opinion inadequate.

Unfortunately the entertainment system suffered technical problems throughout the journey from Doha to London and none of us were able to watch anything.
